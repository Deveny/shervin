<p>Gallery Magazine N°1: VERVELING/ BOREDOM,<br>
for Jan De Vylder and Inge Vinck, Gallery Magazine
</p><p>In the second half of 2019 I contributed to the "boredom/verveling" project of Jan De Vylder and Inge Vinck for <a href="http://gallery-mag.com/" target="_blank">Gallery Magazine</a>.
Here you can see the result cast in the first edition booklet of Gallery Magazine.It was a really nice project to work on and very enthusiastic about the results.</p><p>
Gallery Magazine is a project curated by Jonathan Robert Maj and Johannes Ströhmenger Berry. In each issue one guest architect or practice is invited to realise a vision through the creation of original content. The first guests are Jan De Vylder and Inge Vinck (B), who made a series of excel drawings testing the medium’s limitations.
</p><p>
UNIVERSUM CARROUSSEL JOURNEY is the alter ego for architects jan de vylder inge vinck / inge vinck jan de vylder architects. Maybe this alter ego is even the primary ego.
</p><p>
Three words after each other. No more than three words. And actually only three words. But no more than three words necessary to situate what it should be about for A JDVIV / IVJDV A when the idea of architecture should be given a perspective.
</p><p>
UNIVERSUM as a world that architecture can be. CARROUSEL as the movement that architecture may be. JOURNEY as the trip that architecture will be.
</p><p>
UNIVERSUM CARROUSEL JOURNEY / CARROUSEL JOURNEY UNIVERSUM / JOURNEY UNIVERSUM CARROUSEL or UCJ CJU JUC. Even the order is a carousel. Or a trip. Or a world.
</p><p>
Simultaneously, the order makes the difference. UNIVERSUM CARROUSEL JOURNEY – A STUDIO stands for education. CARROUSEL JOURNEY UNIVERSUM – A PRACTICE stands for practice. JOURNEY UNIVERSUM CARROUSEL – WHATEVER rstands for everything else on the margin.
</p><p>
This book or work is a part of JOURNEY CARROUSEL UNIVERSUM — WHAT EVER and is one of the first ‘phenomena’ of the idea ‘what ever’. Here, Inge Vinck and Jan De Vylder write down their names without mentioning architects jan de vylder inge vinck / inge vinck jan de vylder architects. Amidst ‘what ever’ liberties will be taken and personal perspectives will be given a place. But probably never one without the other.

VERVELING/ BOREDOM,<br>
for Jan De Vylder and Inge Vinck, Gallery Magazine
</p><p>
In the second half of 2019 I contributed to the "boredom/verveling" project of Jan De Vylder and Inge Vinck for <a href="http://gallery-mag.com/" target="_blank">Gallery Magazine</a>.
Here you can see the result cast in flags by <a href="https://019-ghent.org/flags/universum-carrousel-journey-jan-de-vylder-inge-vinck-inge-vinck-jan-de-vylder-architects/" target="_blank">019</a>.
It was a really nice project to work on and very enthusiastic about the results.
</p><p>
Verveling (boredom)<br>
Time for verveling (boredom). In moments of boredom. Just drawing. Everywhere. and with all sorts of things. And so with EXCEL. Again. And now without further ado. Just drawing. In EXCEL.
</p><p>
The verveling (boredom) became the goal in itself. From latent and sporadic boredom to active and continuous exploration. All corners of the sheet. All the instruments of the medium. And all that without purpose. Endless.
</p><p>
The ‘verveling (boredom)’ becomes ‘verveeling (bored-om)’. And EXCEL ‘vervelt(molt)’ into something else. To what this is/ What is this?
</p><p>
UNIVERSUM CARROUSEL JOURNEY is the alter ego for architects jan de vylder inge vinck/inge vinck jan de vylder architects. Maybe this alter ego is even the primo ego.
</p><p>
